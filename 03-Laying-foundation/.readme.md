## 1. What is JSX?

***JSX*** is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. It is mainly used with the React library to build user interfaces, but it can be used with other libraries as well.

Here is an example of JSX that renders a simple heading element:

```
const heading = <h1>Heading</h1>;
```

JSX is not directly executed by the browser, but it is first compiled into plain JavaScript code that the browser can understand. This compilation process is usually done with a tool like Babel, which allows you to use JSX and other modern JavaScript features that may not be supported by all browsers.

JSX can be used to create reusable React components that can be easily composed to build complex user interfaces. It also makes it easier to understand the structure of your UI code, since it allows you to use familiar HTML-like syntax instead of nested JavaScript function calls.

## 2. Superpowers of JSX

JSX has several benefits and features that make it a powerful tool for building user interfaces:

1. **Easy to read and understand:** JSX uses a familiar HTML-like syntax, which makes it easier for developers to read and understand their code.

1. **Components:** JSX makes it easy to define reusable components that can be composed to build complex user interfaces. This helps to keep your code organized and maintainable.

1. **Expressiveness:** JSX allows you to include expressions in your code by using curly braces. This can be used to dynamically render content based on variables or data.

1. **Type checking:** When used with a type-checking tool like Flow or TypeScript, JSX can help catch type errors in your code before it is run.

1. **Optimization:** JSX is transformed into optimized JavaScript code during the compilation process, which can help improve the performance of your applications.

1. **Integration with React:** JSX is an integral part of the React library and is designed to work seamlessly with other React features. It is often used in conjunction with other React features like state and props to build powerful and interactive user interfaces.

## 3. Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?

The type attribute in a script tag specifies the type of script being used in the HTML document. This attribute is optional, but it is a good practice to include it to help browsers and other web tools understand and process your code correctly.

Here are some common options that you can use for the type attribute:

- **text/javascript:** This is the default value for the type attribute, and it indicates that the script is written in JavaScript.

- **text/jsx:** This value indicates that the script is written in JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files.

- **text/typescript:** This value indicates that the script is written in TypeScript, which is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

- **module:** This value indicates that the script is a JavaScript module, which is a file that exports one or more values that can be imported by other scripts.

You can also use other values for the type attribute, such as `text/coffeescript` for CoffeeScript code or `text/babel` for code that is written in a different language and transpiled with Babel.

## 4. {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX

In JSX, curly braces `{}` are used to indicate that the code inside them is a JavaScript expression. The difference between the three examples you provided is how the JSX element is represented.

Here is what each of the examples means:

1. **`{TitleComponent}`:** This is not valid JSX syntax, because it does not include the opening and closing tags for the element.

2. **`{<TitleComponent/>}`:** This is a self-closing JSX element, which means that it does not have any children or content. It is equivalent to an HTML element like `<input>` or `<img>`.

3. **`{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}`:** This is a JSX element with an opening and closing tag, which means that it can have children or content inside it. It is equivalent to an HTML element like `<div>` or `<p>`.

For example, you could use the third syntax to render a `TitleComponent` with some content inside it, like this:

```
<TitleComponent>
  Hello, World!
</TitleComponent>
```

It is important to note that JSX elements must be properly nested and closed, just like HTML elements. This means that if you open a JSX element, you must also close it before you can render another element.
