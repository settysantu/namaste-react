## When and why do we need lazy()?

In React, the `lazy()` function is used for code-splitting, which allows you to load parts of your application on-demand, rather than loading everything at once. This can improve the performance of your application by reducing the initial bundle size and loading only the resources that are needed for a specific part of the application.

The `lazy()` function takes a function that returns a dynamic import, which is a way to import a module or a component only when it is actually needed. The function returns a special object, called a "lazy component", that can be rendered just like a regular component, but it will only load the actual component and its dependencies when it is first rendered.

You would use `lazy()` when you have a large application with many components, some of which are only used in specific parts of the application, and you want to improve the performance of the application by only loading the necessary components as the user navigates through the application.

## What is suspense?

In React, ***Suspense*** is a new feature that allows you to handle the loading state of a component that is being loaded asynchronously, such as a component that is being loaded using the `lazy()` function.

When a lazy component is being loaded, React will render a fallback component that you can specify using the ***Suspense*** component, which acts as a placeholder that is shown to the user while the lazy component is being loaded. This allows you to provide a better user experience by showing a loading spinner, a skeleton, or any other loading indicator while the component is being loaded.

***Suspense*** can be used to handle loading state not only for lazy loading, but also for other asynchronous data fetching like APIs, GraphQL, etc.

You would use ***Suspense*** to handle the loading state of a component that is being loaded asynchronously, such as a component that is being loaded using the `lazy()` function. This allows you to provide a better user experience by showing a loading indicator while the component is being loaded.

## Why we got this error : A component suspended while responding to synchronous input. This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator. To fix, updates that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition? How does suspense fix this error?

The error "A component suspended while responding to synchronous input" occurs when a component that is being rendered synchronously is suspended while waiting for an asynchronous component or data to be loaded. This can happen when using the ***Suspense*** component with a lazy-loaded component, and the lazy-loaded component is not yet available when the synchronously rendered component is trying to use it.

This error occurs because React expects that a component that is suspended while responding to synchronous input will be replaced with a loading indicator, but it's not able to do that because the component was not wrapped with ***startTransition***.

The ***startTransition*** is a utility method provided by React that allows you to start a new transition, which is a way to specify that a component should be replaced with a loading indicator. It's typically used when you are making updates that may suspend, such as when you are calling a setState method or when you are using the ***useEffect*** hook with a dependency that may change.

To fix this error, you should wrap the updates that may suspend with ***startTransition***. This will tell React that it should replace the component with a loading indicator while the update is being processed, which will prevent the error from occurring.

***Suspense*** allows you to declaratively specify a fallback UI that should be rendered while the component or data is loading. It handles the loading state of the component and allows you to provide a consistent loading experience for the user. It also allows you to wrap the updates that might suspend with ***startTransition*** and keep the loading state consistent, which prevent the error from occurring.

## Advantages and disadvantages of using this code splitting pattern?

Advantages of using code-splitting and lazy-loading in React:

- Improved performance: By only loading the resources that are needed for a specific part of the application, the initial bundle size is reduced and the application loads faster.

- Better user experience: By lazy-loading components and handling loading state with Suspense, the application can provide a better user experience by showing a loading indicator while the component is being loaded.

- Easy maintenance: By splitting the code into smaller chunks, it becomes easier to maintain the application, as changes to one part of the application will only affect that part and not the entire application.

- Better SEO: Code-splitting and lazy-loading improves the loading time of the initial render of the page, which helps SEO

Disadvantages of using code-splitting and lazy-loading in React:

- Additional complexity: Code-splitting and lazy-loading can add additional complexity to the application, as it requires more configuration and setup.

- Increased development time: It might take more development time to implement code-splitting and lazy-loading, as it requires more planning and testing.

- Browser support: Code-splitting and lazy-loading require a modern browser to work properly, as it relies on ECMAScript dynamic imports, which are not supported in older browsers.

- Server-side rendering: Server-side rendering might be affected by code-splitting and lazy-loading, as it requires additional configuration and setup to ensure that the correct components are loaded on the server.

In general, code-splitting and lazy-loading can provide significant performance benefits for large and complex applications, but it requires careful planning and testing to implement correctly.

## When do we and why do we need suspense?

You would use ***Suspense*** in React when you want to handle the loading state of a component that is being loaded asynchronously, such as a component that is being loaded using the `lazy()` function or when you are fetching data from an external source like APIs or GraphQL. This allows you to provide a better user experience by showing a loading indicator while the component or the data is being loaded.

Using ***Suspense***, it is possible to declaratively specify a fallback UI that should be rendered while the component or data is loading, instead of having to handle loading state in multiple components or in a centralized state management solution.

Additionally, ***Suspense*** can be used to handle loading state not only for lazy loading, but also for other asynchronous data fetching like APIs, GraphQL, etc.

By using ***Suspense***, it can improve the overall user experience by keeping the loading state consistent and avoiding flashing of loading spinner or other loading indicators. It also allows developers to handle loading state declaratively and make it easier to maintain the application.
