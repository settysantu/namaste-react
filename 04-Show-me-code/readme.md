## Is JSX mandatory for React?

JSX is not mandatory for React, but it is heavily recommended. React's documentation and tutorials often use JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like elements in your JavaScript code. 

It makes it easy to see the structure of your components and the component's relationships to each other. However, you can use React without JSX by using React's `createElement` method to create and manipulate elements.

## Is ES6 mandatory for React?

***ES6***, or ***ECMAScript 6***, is not mandatory for React, but it is recommended. ***ES6*** is the latest version of JavaScript, and it provides new features and syntax that can make your code more expressive and maintainable. 

React itself is written using ***ES6***, and many of its examples and documentation use ***ES6*** features. You can use React with an older version of JavaScript, but using ***ES6*** can make it easier to write and understand React code. 

Also, keep in mind that the use of ***ES6*** syntaxes is not dependent on the library or framework, you can use ***ES6*** features in plain javascript also.

## {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX

In JSX, the way you write a component can take a few different forms.

`{TitleComponent}` is a JavaScript expression that evaluates to the component itself. This is used when you want to pass the component as a prop to another component. For example:

```
<ParentComponent title={TitleComponent} />
```

`{<TitleComponent/>}` is a JSX element that instantiates the TitleComponent component. This is the most common way to use a component in JSX. For example:

```
<TitleComponent />
```

`{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}` is also a JSX element that instantiates the TitleComponent component, but it allows you to include content between the opening and closing tags of the component. This is not used as frequently, this is more useful when you have a component that you want to wrap around some element.

```
<TitleComponent>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</TitleComponent>
```

All of the above examples are functional, depends on the context in which you are using, but the first and second one is widely used.

## How can I write comments in JSX?

In JSX, you can include comments by wrapping them in curly braces and using the JavaScript comment syntax. Here's an example:

```
<div>
  {/* This is a JSX comment */}
  <p>This is some content.</p>
</div>
```

## What is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></> ?

`<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>` are both ways to represent a "fragment" of JSX elements in React. A fragment is a way to group a set of children elements together, without adding an extra node to the DOM.

`<React.Fragment>` is the original way to create a fragment, it's a component that is used to group a set of children without adding any extra elements to the DOM, it's useful in scenarios where you want to return multiple element but don't want to create an extra parent container.

```
  <React.Fragment>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Description</p>
  </React.Fragment>
```

In the above example `React.Fragment` is used to group two element together, `<h1>Title</h1>` and `<p>Description</p>` and React will treat this as if they were siblings and not enclosed in a extra parent.

`<> </>` is a shorthand for `<React.Fragment> </React.Fragment>` and it was introduced in React 16.2, it is a shorter and more convenient syntax to use fragments,

```
  <>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Description</p>
  </>
```

it functions the same way as <React.Fragment> but it is less verbose, as you don't need to type React.Fragment and it behaves the same way as the previous example.

It is important to note that only one element can be returned from a component and in scenarios where you want to return multiple elements you can use the above mentioned syntaxes to wrap the multiple elements together, which will be treated as if they were wrapped by a single element.

## What is Virtual DOM?

The ***Virtual DOM (VDOM)*** is a programming concept used by libraries and frameworks like React to improve the performance of web applications. The idea behind the ***VDOM*** is to have a JavaScript representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) that the browser uses to render web pages.

When a component in a React application is updated, React will first update the component's ***VDOM*** representation. Then, React will use a process called **"reconciliation"** to compare the updated ***VDOM*** to the previous version of the ***VDOM***, and determine the minimal set of changes that need to be made to the actual DOM.

Because the ***VDOM*** is a lightweight JavaScript object and not the actual DOM, this process is much faster than updating the actual DOM directly. React then makes those minimal changes to the actual DOM, which is much faster than rebuilding the entire DOM.

Using a ***VDOM*** can greatly improve the performance of web applications, especially those that have many dynamic elements or complex user interactions. The ***VDOM*** allows React to update the UI in a efficient way and can greatly reduce the time taken to render a component.

The key feature of ***VDOM*** is that it provides a faster, more efficient way to update the user interface by making a copy of the current UI and making any changes on the copy, then comparing the copy with the previous version, then only updating the difference between the current and previous version, it helps in making the updates faster and efficient.

## What is Reconciliation in React?

***Reconciliation*** is the process that React uses to update the actual DOM to reflect changes made to a component's virtual DOM (VDOM) representation. When a component's state or props change, React will first update the component's VDOM, and then compare the updated VDOM to the previous version of the VDOM.

During this comparison, React uses a process called "***reconciliation***" to determine the minimal set of changes that need to be made to the actual DOM in order to make it match the updated VDOM. This process involves a comparison of the updated VDOM with the previous version of the VDOM, taking into account the component's type and key, and determines the minimum set of updates needed to bring the actual DOM in line with the updated VDOM.

***Reconciliation*** is an efficient process because it only updates the parts of the DOM that have actually changed, rather than re-rendering the entire component. React uses heuristics to make this process more efficient by using a technique called "keys", which are special attributes that you can assign to elements in a component's VDOM to help React keep track of which elements are added, removed, or changed.

React uses a two-pass process during the ***reconciliation***. First, it checks the difference between current and new virtual tree and it will update the nodes if it has a change. Then it checks if any node needs to be added or removed.

The result of this process is that React can efficiently update the user interface with minimal performance overhead, which can greatly improve the performance and responsiveness of web applications, especially those with many dynamic elements or complex user interactions.

## What is React Fiber?

React Fiber is a complete rewrite of the React library's core algorithm. It was first released as part of React 16 in September 2017. The main goal of React Fiber is to improve the performance of React applications by making the reconciliation process (the process by which React updates the DOM) more efficient. 

It does this by breaking the work of updating the component tree into smaller chunks that can be spread out over multiple frames, allowing the browser to respond to user input and other events more smoothly. 

Additionally, React Fiber also introduces new features such as the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as needed, which makes it easier to build high-performance animations and other interactive experiences with React.

## Why we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?

In React, when you create a list of elements, you need to give each element a unique key to help React keep track of which items are added, changed, or removed. This is necessary because React uses a ***virtual DOM (Document Object Model)*** to optimize updates and minimize the number of changes made to the actual ***DOM***.

Without ***keys***, React would have to re-render the entire list whenever an item is added, changed, or removed, which would be slow and inefficient. Instead, React uses the ***keys*** to identify which items have changed, and only updates the specific items that have changed. This improves the performance of your application and makes updates smoother.

You should use ***keys*** when you create a list of elements in a component's render method. The key should be a unique identifier for the element. Commonly it is best practice to use ids that come from the data you are rendering, or a unique index of the element.
It's important to note that ***keys*** only need to be unique among its siblings, not globally unique.

In short, React uses ***keys*** to keep track of the elements in a list, so that it can efficiently update the list when changes are made.

## Can we use index as keys in React?

Using the ***index*** of an element as its key when creating a list of elements in React is generally considered an ***anti-pattern*** and is discouraged.

When you use the ***index*** of an element as its key, React uses that ***index*** to keep track of the elements in the list. However, if an element is added, removed, or moved in the list, React will not be able to correctly determine which items have changed and will re-render the entire list instead of just the specific items that have changed. This can lead to poor performance, especially for large lists.

Additionally, If the data that you are using to render the list changes then using the ***index*** as key will not work as expected, because ***index*** positions also changes.

A better approach would be to use a unique identifier for each element, such as an id or a uuid, as the key. This ensures that each element has a unique key, even if the elements are reordered or added or removed.

In summary, using ***index*** as keys in React can lead to poor performance and unexpected behavior, it's best to avoid that, and use unique id of each element.

## What is props in React? Ways to

In React, props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to its child component. They are a way for a parent component to communicate with its child component and to share data between them.

A component can receive props by using the ***props*** parameter in its render method. The component can then access the data passed in the props and use it to render its output. For example:

```
function MyComponent(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

// Parent component
function App() {
  return <MyComponent name="John" />;
}
```

In this example, the ***MyComponent*** component receives a prop called ***name***, and the value of this prop is "John". The component then uses this prop to render the output `Hello, John`.

You can pass any type of data as props. For example, you can pass numbers, strings, arrays, objects, and functions.
You can also pass components as props, this is called "children prop" that allow the parent component to render child component with specific data that the child component will use.

It's important to note that props are read-only, which means that a component cannot modify its props. However, a component can call a callback function passed as a prop to communicate with its parent component and request data updates.

## What is a Config Driven UI?

A config-driven UI is a UI that is built using a configuration file or data, rather than hard-coded logic or components. With a config-driven UI, the look and behavior of the UI can be changed by modifying the configuration file, without having to change the source code of the application. This can make it easier to manage and maintain the UI, and can also make it more flexible and reusable.

A config-driven UI can be implemented in various ways, but generally it involves creating a separate configuration file or data structure that defines the layout and behavior of the UI. This configuration file can be written in any format that can be easily parsed and understood by the application, such as JSON or YAML.

The application then uses this configuration file to build the UI dynamically at runtime, rather than hard-coding the UI in the source code. This can make it easier to update the UI without having to change the source code, and can also make it easier to reuse the same UI in multiple places or contexts.

A config-driven UI can be particularly useful in situations where the design of the UI needs to be changed frequently or where the same UI needs to be used in multiple places with different data.

Also, a config-driven UI can help to separate concerns, making developer's job easier, as they need not to worry about the UI and it's layout, they can focus on business logic and leave UI management to designers or non-technical members of the team.
